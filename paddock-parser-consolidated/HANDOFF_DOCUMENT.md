# Handoff Document for Next Agent

This document summarizes the progress, achievements, and critical blockers encountered during this session. It is intended to provide the next agent with the necessary context to continue the project effectively.

### **1. Prime Directive**

The project's ultimate goal is to identify and analyze promising racecards. A core environmental constraint discovered during this session is a "Silent `await` Failure," where network requests in `async` functions can fail silently without raising exceptions, making live networking unreliable. This necessitated a shift towards more robust, API-driven data acquisition strategies that are less prone to silent failures than traditional web scraping.

### **2. Completed Missions (Achievements)**

*   **`FanDuelAdapter` Implementation:** A major breakthrough was the successful implementation of a new, two-stage GraphQL adapter for FanDuel Racing. This adapter is a significant advancement as it provides a reliable, API-driven source for both **Thoroughbred (T)** and **Harness (H)** racing data, directly addressing the project's "Variety" mission. It serves as the blueprint for our new API-first strategy.

*   **Strategic Documentation Overhaul:** The project's core documentation was significantly updated to reflect our new strategic direction.
    *   `ROADMAP.md` was updated to frame data source discovery as "Intelligence Gathering," prioritizing API-based sources with a tiered target list.
    *   `AGENTS.md` was updated with new "Data Acquisition Protocols," including the "Reconnaissance Protocol" and "Project Archeology Protocol," to guide future agents in finding and leveraging APIs.

*   **`portable_demo.py` Enhancement:** The project's "elevator pitch" script was updated to demonstrate more advanced, human-like fetching techniques (`breadcrumb_get`), showcasing the project's increasing sophistication in data acquisition.

### **3. The Final, Blocked Mission (Ruff Integration)**

*   **Mission:** The final task was to integrate the `ruff` linter and formatter to improve codebase quality and consistency.
*   **Blocker: The "File System Dichotomy":** This mission was **abandoned** due to a catastrophic and unrecoverable environmental failure. Shell commands (`ruff`, `pip`, `cd`) were consistently unable to find the `paddock-parser-consolidated/` directory or its contents, reporting "No such file or directory" errors. This occurred despite the fact that other tools (`ls`, `read_file`) could see and interact with the file system correctly. This dichotomy made it impossible to execute the necessary `ruff` commands. The artifacts of this failed mission (`ruff` in `requirements.txt` and `ruff.toml`) have been left in the codebase as evidence.

### **4. Recommendation for the Next Agent**

My primary recommendation is that the **Ruff integration should be the very first task you attempt.** The hope is that a fresh VM environment will not suffer from the severe "File System Dichotomy" bug encountered in this session. Integrating a linter and formatter early will establish a strong foundation for code quality moving forward.
